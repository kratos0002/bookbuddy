4777	4998	4775	4776	the soldiers	468	’ boots formed the background to Goldstein ’s bleating voice . Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds , uncon- trollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room . The self - satisfied sheep - like face on the screen , and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it , were too much to be borne : besides , the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger au - tomatically . He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia , since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other . But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody , although every day and a thousand times a day , on platforms , on the telescreen , in newspapers , in books , his theories were refuted , smashed , ridiculed , held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rub - bish that they were — in spite of all this , his influence never seemed to grow less . Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him . A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked

6196	6328	6157	6161	the entire group of people	505	’ and the second — a heavy , murmurous sound , somehow curiously savage , in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom- toms . For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up . It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion . Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother , but still more it was an act of self - hypnosis , a deliberate drowning of conscious - ness by means of rhythmic noise . Winston ’s entrails seemed to grow cold . In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium , but this sub - human chant -

7885	8088	8091	8092	the children	535	’ flat was bigger than Winston ’s , and dingy in a different way . Everything had a battered , trampled - on look , as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal . Games impedimenta — hockey - sticks , box - ing - gloves , a burst football , a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out — lay all over the floor , and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog - eared exercise - books . On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies , and a full - sized poster of Big Brother . There was the usual boiled - cabbage smell , common to the whole building , but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat , which — one knew this at the first sniff , though it was hard to say how — was the sweat of some person not present at the mo - ment . In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen . ‘
8094	8111	8112	8112	They	535	’ said Mrs Parsons , casting a half - ap - prehensive glance at the door . ‘

8475	8482	8484	8484	Winston	132	‘ Have you got a spanner ? ’

Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe . He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room . ‘
8602	8710	8711	8711	You	545	’ yelled a savage voice . A handsome , tough - looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol , while his small sister , about two years younger , made the same gesture with a fragment of wood . Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts , grey shirts , and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies . Winston raised his hands above his head , but with an un - easy feeling , so vicious was the boy ’s demeanour , that it was not altogether a game . ‘

8867	8905	8906	8906	They	547	’ eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children , and back again . In the better light of the living- room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face . ‘
8912	8916	8917	8917	They	547	’ she said . ‘

8989	9119	8945	8945	Tom	142	’ chanted the little girl , still capering round . Some Eurasian prisoners , guilty of war crimes , were to be hanged in the Park that evening , Winston remembered . This happened about once a month , and was a popular spec- tacle . Children always clamoured to be taken to see it . He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door . But he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow . It was as though a red - hot wire had been jabbed into him . He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult .

It was not true , for example , as was claimed in the Party history books , that the Party had invented aeroplanes . He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood . But you could prove nothing . There was never any evidence . Just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact . And on that occasion — — ‘

At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Par - ty shops were unable to supply . Sometimes it was buttons , sometimes it was darning wool , sometimes it was shoelaces ; at present it was razor blades . You could only get hold of them , if at all , by scrounging more or less furtively on the ‘

He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of he - licopter raids on enemy villages , and trials and confessions of thought - criminals , the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love . Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him ,

19323	19387	19236	19236	his	132	’ yelled the white - aproned prole with the la - dle . Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille . On to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch — a metal pannikin of pinkish - grey stew , a hunk of bread , a cube of cheese , a mug of milkless Victory Coffee , and one saccharine tablet . ‘

They threaded their way across the crowded room and un - packed their trays on to the metal - topped table , on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew , a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit . Winston took up his mug of gin , paused for an instant to collect his nerve , and gulped the oily - tasting stuff down . When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discov - ered that he was hungry . He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew , which , in among its general sloppiness , had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat . Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied

20186	20192	20184	20184	Winston	132	’ he said almost sadly . ‘
20199	20216	20195	20195	you	829	’re still thinking in Oldspeak . I ’ve read some of those pieces that you write in ‘
20219	20223	20175	20175	You	829	’ occasionally . They ’re
20229	20263	20228	20228	they	830	’re translations . In your heart you ’d prefer to stick to Oldspeak , with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning . You do n’t grasp the beauty of the destruction of
20290	20334	20195	20195	you	829	’ Winston did know that , of course . He smiled , sympa - thetically he hoped , not trusting himself to speak . Syme bit off another fragment of the dark - coloured bread , chewed it briefly , and went on : ‘
20414	20520	20521	20521	he	134	’re not far from that point . But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead . Every year fewer and fewer words , and the range of consciousness always a little smaller . Even now , of course , there ’s no reason or ex - cuse for committing thoughtcrime . It ’s merely a question of self - discipline , reality - control . But in the end there wo n’t be any need even for that . The Revolution will be com - plete when the language is perfect . Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak , ’
20532	20573	20521	20521	he	134	‘ Has it ever occurred to you , Winston , that by the year 2050 , at the very latest , not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now ? ’
20574	20578	20580	20580	Winston	132	‘ Except — — ’
20598	20603	20605	20605	he	134	‘ Except the proles , ’
20639	20647	20648	20648	he	134	‘ The proles are not human beings , ’
20652	20739	20648	20648	he	134	‘ By 2050 — earlier , probably — all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared . The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed . Chaucer , Shakespeare , Milton , By - ron — they’ll exist only in Newspeak versions , not merely changed into something different , but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be . Even the literature of the Party will change . Even the slogans will change . How could you have a slogan like ‘
20745	20794	20648	20648	he	134	’ when the concept of freedom has been abolished ? The whole climate of thought will be different . In fact there will be no thought , as we understand it now . Orthodoxy means not thinking — not needing to think . Orthodoxy is uncon - sciousness . ’
20933	20937	20927	20927	Winston	132	‘ I think you ’re
20952	21298	20946	20946	I	0	’ , uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice . But the other voice never stopped for an in - stant , even when the girl was speaking . Winston knew the man by sight , though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department . He was a man of about thirty , with a muscular throat and a large , mobile mouth . His head was thrown back a little , and because of the angle at which he was sitting , his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes . What was slightly horrible , was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word . Just once Winston caught a phrase—’complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism’—jerked out very rapidly and , as it seemed , all in one piece , like a line of type cast solid . For the rest it was just a noise , a quack - quack - quacking . And yet , though you could not actually hear what the man was saying , you could not be in any doubt about its general nature . He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought - criminals and saboteurs , he might be ful - minating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army , he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front — it made no difference . Whatever it was , you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy , pure Ingsoc . As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down , Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy . It was not the man ’s brain that was speaking , it was his larynx . The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words , but
21369	21377	21379	21379	Syme	160	‘ There is a word in Newspeak , ’
21381	21434	21436	21436	Syme	160	‘ I do n’t know whether you know it : DUCKSPEAK , to quack like a duck . It is one of those interesting words that have two contradic - tory meanings . Applied to an opponent , it is abuse , applied to someone you agree with , it is praise . ’
21767	21772	21773	21773	he	170	‘ Here comes Parsons , ’
21787	21791	21793	21793	Parsons	141	‘ that bloody fool ’

22138	22180	22125	22125	you	173	’ said Winston , automatically feel - ing for money . About a quarter of one ’s salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions , which were so nu - merous that it was difficult to keep track of them . ‘

22613	22617	22618	22618	Ah	880	’ said Winston . ‘

Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up . Most of the people paid no attention to Winston ; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity . Two monstrous women with brick - red forearms folded across thelr aprons were talking outside a doorway . Winston caught scraps of conversation as he ap - proached . ‘

Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route : but it was enough to draw atten - tion to you if the Thought Police heard about it . Suddenly the whole street was in commotion . There were yells of warning from all sides . People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits . A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston , grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle , whipped her apron round it , and leapt back again , all in one movement . At the same instant a man in a concertina - like black suit , who had emerged from a side alley , ran towards Winston , pointing excitedly to the sky . ‘

35149	35296	35134	35134	Pint	1294	’ The barman swished two half - litres of dark - brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter . Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs . The proles were supposed not to drink gin , though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough . The game of darts was in full swing again , and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets . Winston ’s presence was forgotten for a moment . There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard . It was horribly dangerous , but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room , a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in . ‘

35438	35473	35434	35434	he	132	‘ And cheaper ! When I was a young man , mild beer — wallop we used to call it — was fourpence a pint . That was before the war , of course . ’

37996	38223	37985	37985	I	0	’ The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full , but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest val - ue . The floorspace was very restricted , because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture - frames . In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts , worn - out chisels , penknives with broken blades , tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order , and other miscellaneous rubbish . Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends — lacquered snuffbox - es , agate brooches , and the like — which looked as though they might include something interesting . As Winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round , smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight , and he picked it up . It was a heavy lump of glass , curved on one side , flat on the other , making almost a hemisphere . There was a peculiar softness , as of rainwater , in both the colour and the texture of the glass . At the heart of it , magnified by the curved surface , there was a strange , pink , convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone . ‘
38228	38234	37985	37985	I	0	’ said Winston , fascinated . ‘

38406	38579	38586	38586	you	1370	’ Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket . What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the pres - ent one . The soft , rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen . The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness , though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight . It was very heavy in his pocket , but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge . It was a queer thing , even a compromising thing , for a Party member to have in his possession . Anything old , and for that matter anything beautiful , was always vaguely suspect . The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars . Winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two . ‘
38595	38599	38586	38586	you	1370	’ he said . ‘

38842	39012	38830	38830	I	0	’ He was holdlng the lamp high up , so as to illuminate the whole room , and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting . The thought flitted through Winston ’s mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week , if he dared to take the risk . It was a wild , impossible notion , to be abandoned as soon as thought of ; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia , a sort of ancestral memory . It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this , in an arm- chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob ; utterly alone , utterly secure , with nobody watching you , no voice pursuing you , no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock . ‘
39018	39025	38830	38830	I	0	’ he could not help murmuring . ‘
39028	39034	39035	39035	I	0	’ said the old man , ‘
39096	39198	39089	39089	you	665	’ There was a small bookcase in the other corner , and Winston had already gravitated towards it . It contained nothing but rubbish . The hunting - down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else . It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960 . The old man , still carrying the lamp , was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace , opposite the bed . ‘
39214	39295	39089	39089	you	665	’ he began delicately . Winston came across to examine the picture . It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular win - dows , and a small tower in front . There was a railing running round the building , and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue . Winston gazed at it for some moments . It seemed vaguely familiar , though he did not re - member the statue . ‘
39304	39310	39089	39089	you	665	’ said the old man , ‘

39394	39410	39468	39468	I	0	’ He smiled apologetically , as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous , and add -

39428	39433	39435	39435	Winston	132	‘ What ’s that ? ’
39437	39450	39435	39435	Winston	132	‘ Oh—‘Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement ’s . ’

39570	39695	39696	39696	I	0	’ Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged . It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building . Anything large and impressive , if it was reasonably new in appearance , was automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution , while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages . The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value . One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books . Statues , inscriptions , memori - al stones , the names of streets — anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered . ‘

At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive had welled up in him , and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid . It was not till twenty - three hours , when he was home and in bed — in the darkness , where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent — that he was able to think continuously . It was a physical problem that had to be solved : how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting . He did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him . He knew that it was not so , because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note . Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits , as well she might be . Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind . Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone , but that was of no importance . He thought of her naked , youth - ful body , as he had seen it in his dream . He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them , her head stuffed with lies and hatred , her belly full of ice . A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her , the white youthful body might slip away from him ! What he feared more than any - thing else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly . But the physical dif - ficulty of meeting was enormous . It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated . Whichever way you turned , the telescreen faced you . Actually , all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to

Then , as though touching her waist had reminded her of something , she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate . She broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston . Even be - fore he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate . It was dark and shiny , and was wrapped in silver paper . Chocolate normally was dull - brown crum - bly stuff that tasted , as nearly as one could describe it , like the smoke of a rubbish fire . But at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him . The first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down , but which was powerful and trou - bling . ‘

A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language . Party members were supposed not to swear , and Winston himself very seldom did swear , aloud , at any rate . Julia , however , seemed unable to mention the Party , and especially the Inner Party , without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alley - ways . He did not dislike it . It was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways , and somehow it seemed natural and healthy , like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay . They had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade , with their arms round each other ’s waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast . He noticed how much softer her waist seemed

Winston looked out into the field beyond , and underwent a curious , slow shock of recognition . He knew it by sight . An old , closebitten pasture , with a foot - path wandering across it and a molehill here and there . In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze , and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women ’s hair . Surely somewhere nearby , but out of sight , there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming ? ‘

Not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct , the simple undifferentiated desire : that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces . He pressed her down upon the grass , among the fallen bluebells . This time there was no difficul - ty . Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed , and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they

Even now he had not found out her surname or her address . However , it made no difference , for it was incon - ceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication . As it happened , they never went back to the clearing in the wood . During the month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in mak - ing love . That was in another hidlng - place known to Julia , the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost - deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier . It was a good hiding - place when once you got there , but the getting there was very dangerous . For the rest they could meet only in the streets , in a different place every eve - ning and never for more than half an hour at a time . In the street it was usually possible to talk , after a fashion . As they drifted down the crowded pavements , not quite abreast and never looking at one another , they carried on a curi -

He was standing a little behind her , and he put his hand on her waist to steady her . At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were . There was not a human creature anywhere , not a leaf stirring , not even a bird awake . In a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small , and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds . It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon . The sun blazed down upon them , the sweat tick - led his face . And the thought struck him ... ‘

She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individ - ual is always defeated . In a way she realized that she herself was doomed , that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her , but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a se - cret world in which you could live as you chose . All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness . She did not un - derstand that there was no such thing as happiness , that the only victory lay in the far future , long after you were dead , that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse . ‘

He wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and with - out fear , talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household . He wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met . It was not actually at that moment , but at some time on the following day , that the idea of renting Mr Charrington ’s room had oc-

The smell was already filling the room , a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood , but which one did occasionally meet with even now , blow - ing down a passage - way before a door slammed , or diffusing itself mysteriously in a crowded street , sniffed for an instant and then lost again . ‘

Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air , very tuneful , charged with a sort of happy melancholy . One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content , if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes in - exhaustible , to remain there for a thousand years , pegging out diapers and singing rubbish . It struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously . It would even have seemed slightly unorthodox , a dangerous eccentricity , like talking to one - self . Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about . ‘
57127	57191	57121	57121	You	1812	’ said Julia . He turned round , and for a second almost failed to rec - ognize her . What he had actually expected was to see her naked . But she was not naked . The transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that . She had painted her face . She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian

Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body , with the vari - cose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle . There were no sheets , but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth , and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them . ‘
57570	57851	57413	57413	I	0	’ said Julia . One never saw a double bed nowadays , except in the homes of the proles . Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood : Julia had never been in one before , so far as she could remember . Presently they fell asleep for a little while . When Win - ston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine . He did not stir , because Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm . Most of her make - up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster , but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone . A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace , where the water in the pan was boiling fast . Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing , but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street . He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this , in the cool of a summer evening , a man and a woman with no clothes on , making love when they chose , talking of what they chose , not feeling any compulsion to get up , simply ly - ing there and listening to peaceful sounds outside . Surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordi - nary ? Julia woke up , rubbed her eyes , and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove . ‘

For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time through - out his life . It was always very much the same . He was standing in front of a wall of darkness , and on the other

63446	63456	63443	63443	he	132	‘ I was reading one of your Newspeak articles in ‘
63459	63475	63476	63476	Winston	132	’ the other day . You take a scholarly interest in Newspeak , I believe ? ’
63486	63490	63491	63491	he	132	‘ Hardly scholarly , ’
63494	63496	63498	63499	an amateur	1961	‘ I ’m
63527	63528	63530	63530	you	1962	’ ‘
63536	63540	63530	63530	you	1962	’ said O’Brien . ‘
63574	63701	63703	63703	I	0	’ Again Winston ’s heart stirred painfully . It was incon - ceivable that this was anything other than a reference to Syme . But Syme was not only dead , he was abolished , an unperson . Any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous . O’Brien ’s remark must obviously have been intended as a signal , a codeword . By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices . They had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor , but now O’Brien halted . With the curious , dis - arming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose . Then he went on : ‘
63747	63748	63737	63737	you	1966	’ ‘
63751	63755	63756	63756	I	0	’ said Winston . ‘
63777	63778	63766	63766	We	1968	’ ‘
63821	63822	63811	63811	you	1966	’ ‘
63827	63833	63811	63811	you	1966	’ said Winston , immediately seeing where
63838	63923	63924	63924	They	1968	‘ Some of the new developments are most ingenious . The reduction in the number of verbs — that is the point that will appeal to you , I think . Let me see , shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary ? But I am afraid I invariably for - get anything of that kind . Perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you ? Wait . Let me give you my address . ’
64000	64010	64011	64011	he	216	‘ I am usually at home in the evenings , ’
64014	64026	64027	64027	He	216	‘ If not , my servant will give you the dictionary . ’
64149	64162	64433	64434	W inston	148	‘ If you ever want to see me , this is where I can
64171	64429	64433	64434	W inston	148	’ was what O’Brien had been saying to him . Per - haps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary . But at any rate , one thing was certain . The conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist , and he had reached the outer edges of it . He knew that sooner or later he would obey O’Brien ’s summons . Perhaps tomorrow , perhaps after a long de - lay — he was not certain . What was happening was only the working - out of a process that had started years ago . The first step had been a secret , involuntary thought , the sec - ond had been the opening of the diary . He had moved from thoughts to words , and now from words to actions . The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love . He had accepted it . The end was contained in the be - ginning . But it was frightening : or , more exactly , it was like a foretaste of death , like being a little less alive . Even while he was speaking to O’Brien , when the meaning of the words had sunk in , a chilly shuddering feeling had taken posses - sion of his body . He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave , and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him .
64459	64465	64445	64447	Ju - lia	196	‘ What ’s the matter ? ’
64466	64470	64471	64471	he	148	‘ I dreamt — ’
64674	64679	64680	64680	he	148	‘ Do you know , ’
64683	64696	64680	64680	he	148	‘ that until this moment I believed I had murdered my mother ? ’
64697	64704	64706	64706	Julia	207	‘ Why did you murder her ? ’
64711	64721	64706	64706	Julia	207	‘ I did n’t murder her . Not physically . ’
65402	65405	65400	65400	he	132	‘ the boy ’
65806	65811	65786	65786	he	132	‘ Winston , Winston ! ’
65818	65829	65830	65830	He	132	‘ Come back ! Give your sister back her chocolate ! ’
66247	66260	66261	66261	she	207	‘ I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days , ’
66265	66271	66261	66261	she	207	‘ All children are swine . ’
66272	66284	66286	66286	her	207	‘ Yes . But the real point of the story — — ’
66842	66849	66850	66850	he	2053	‘ The proles are human beings , ’
66854	66860	66850	66850	he	2053	‘ We are not human . ’
66861	66865	66867	66867	Julia	207	‘ Why not ? ’
66882	66890	66891	66891	he	2053	‘ Has it ever occurred to you , ’
66894	66924	66891	66891	he	2053	‘ that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before it ’s too late , and never see each other again ? ’
66925	66941	66850	66850	he	2053	‘ Yes , dear , it has occurred to me , several times . But I ’m

66959	66962	66954	66954	We	2058	’ he said ‘
66972	66999	66971	66971	You	2059	’re young . You look normal and innocent . If you keep clear of people like me , you might stay alive for another fifty years . ’
67000	67015	66954	66954	We	2058	‘ No . I ’ve thought it all out . What you do , I ’m
67028	67035	67027	67027	I	0	’m rather good at staying alive . ’
67036	67058	66971	66971	You	2059	‘ We may be together for another six months — a year — there ’s no knowing . At the end we ’re
67198	67199	67201	67201	you	2059	’ ‘
67205	67209	67210	67210	we	2058	’ she said , ‘
67232	67233	67234	67234	I	0	’ ‘
67274	67280	67281	67281	They	2058	’ She thought it over . ‘
67287	67294	67281	67281	They	2058	’ she said final - ly . ‘
67330	67331	67323	67323	They	2058	’ ‘
67334	67342	67323	67323	They	2058	’ he said a little more hopefully , ‘
67385	67540	67380	67380	you	2067	’ He thought of the telescreen with its never - sleeping ear . They could spy upon you night and day , but if you kept your head you could still outwit them . With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what an - other human being was thinking . Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands . One did not know what happened inside the Ministry of Love , but it was pos - sible to guess : tortures , drugs , delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions , gradual wearing - down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning . Facts , at any rate , could not be kept hidden . They could be tracked down by enquiry , they could be squeezed out of you by torture . But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay

68378	68385	68386	68386	he	132	‘ You can turn it off ! ’
68389	68392	68394	68394	O’Brien	216	‘ Yes , ’
68396	68409	68410	68410	He	132	‘ we can turn it off . We have that privi- lege . ’
68549	68559	68560	68560	he	132	‘ Shall I say it , or will you ? ’
68563	68569	68571	68571	Winston	132	‘ I will say it , ’
68574	68582	68571	68571	Winston	132	‘ That thing is really turned off ? ’
68583	68595	68571	68571	Winston	132	‘ Yes , everything is turned off . We are alone . ’
68596	68604	68605	68605	He	132	‘ We have come here because — — ’
68665	68762	68763	68763	He	2089	‘ We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy , some kind of secret organization working against the Party , and that you are involved in it . We want to join it and work for it . We are enemies of the Party . We disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc . We are thought - criminals . We are also adulter - ers . I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy . If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way , we are ready . ’
68810	68817	68819	68819	O’Brien	216	‘ Martin is one of us , ’
68822	68864	68819	68819	O’Brien	216	‘ Bring the drinks over here , Martin . Put them on the round table . Have we enough chairs ? Then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort . Bring a chair for yourself , Martin . This is
68882	69065	68872	68873	a servant	2092	’ The little man sat down , quite at his ease , and yet still with a servant - like air , the air of a valet enjoying a priv - ilege . Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye . It struck him that the man ’s whole life was playing a part , and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed per - sonality even for a moment . O’Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark - red liquid . It aroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding — a vast bottle composed of elec- tric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass . Seen from the top the stuff looked al - most black , but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby . It had a sour - sweet smell . He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity . ‘
69071	69079	69080	69080	You	2091	’ said O’Brien with a faint smile . ‘
69106	69119	69120	69120	I	0	’ His face grew solemn again , and he raised his glass : ‘
69144	69227	69139	69142	Em - manuel Goldstein	212	’ Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness . Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about . Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington ’s half - remembered rhymes , it belonged to the vanished , romantic past , the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts . For some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste , like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxi -
69274	69284	69285	69285	he	2096	‘ Then there is such a person as Goldstein ? ’
69288	69309	69285	69285	he	2096	‘ Yes , there is such a person , and he is alive . Where , I do not know . ’
69310	69333	69285	69285	he	2096	‘ And the conspiracy — the organization ? Is it real ? It is not simply an invention of the Thought Police ? ’
69334	69378	69379	69379	He	2096	‘ No , it is real . The Brotherhood , we call it . You will never learn much more about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it . I will come back to that pres - ently . ’
69387	69473	69379	69379	He	2096	‘ It is unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour . You ought not to have come here together , and you will have to leave separately . You , com - rade’—he bowed his head to Julia—’will leave first . We have about twenty minutes at our disposal . You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions . In general terms , what are you prepared to do ? ’
69474	69482	69484	69484	Winston	132	‘ Anything that we are capable of , ’
69565	69574	69531	69531	He	132	‘ You are prepared to give your lives ? ’
69576	69579	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69580	69588	69531	69531	He	132	‘ You are prepared to commit murder ? ’
69589	69592	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69593	69610	69531	69531	He	132	‘ To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people ? ’
69611	69614	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69615	69624	69531	69531	He	132	‘ To betray your country to foreign powers ? ’
69625	69628	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69629	69686	69531	69531	He	132	‘ You are prepared to cheat , to forge , to blackmail , to cor - rupt the minds of children , to distribute habit - forming drugs , to encourage prostitution , to disseminate venereal diseases — to do anything which is likely to cause demoral - ization and weaken the power of the Party ? ’
69687	69690	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69691	69720	69531	69531	He	132	‘ If , for example , it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child ’s face — are you prepared to do that ? ’
69721	69724	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69725	69750	69531	69531	He	132	‘ You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dock - worker ? ’
69751	69754	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69755	69775	69531	69531	He	132	‘ You are prepared to commit suicide , if and when we or - der you to do so ? ’
69776	69779	69531	69531	He	132	‘ Yes . ’
69780	69799	69531	69531	He	132	‘ You are prepared , the two of you , to separate and never see one another again ? ’
69800	69803	69806	69806	Julia	207	‘ No ! ’
69886	69889	69890	69890	he	132	‘ No , ’
69894	69902	69904	69904	O’Brien	216	‘ You did well to tell me , ’
69906	69916	69917	69917	He	132	‘ It is necessary for us to know everything . ’
69934	70020	70021	70021	Winston	132	‘ Do you understand that even if he survives , it may be as a different person ? We may be obliged to give him a new identity . His face , his movements , the shape of his hands , the colour of his hair — even his voice would be different . And you yourself might have become a different person . Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition . Some - times it is necessary . Sometimes we even amputate a limb . ’
70073	70081	70064	70064	She	207	‘ Good . Then that is settled . ’
70162	70174	70175	70175	he	216	‘ You had better go back to your Pantry , Martin , ’
70178	70197	70175	70175	he	216	‘ I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour . Take a good look at these comrades ’
70214	70326	70327	70327	You	2099	’ Exactly as they had done at the front door , the little man ’s dark eyes flickered over their faces . There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner . He was memorizing their appearance , but he felt no interest in them , or appeared to feel none . It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression . Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation , Martin went out , closing the door silently behind him . O’Brien was strolling up and down , one hand in the pocket of his black overalls , the other holding his cigarette . ‘
70330	70334	70327	70327	You	2099	’ he said , ‘
70629	70754	70614	70614	I	0	’ He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet . In spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements . It came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket , or manipu - lated a cigarette . More even than of strength , he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony . However much in earnest he might be , he had nothing of the single - mindedness that belongs to a fanatic . When he spoke of murder , suicide , venereal disease , am - putated limbs , and altered faces , it was with a faint air of persiflage . ‘
70759	70766	70614	70614	I	0	’ his voice seemed to say ; ‘
70794	70878	70614	70614	I	0	’ A wave of admiration , almost of worship , flowed out from Winston towards O’Brien . For the moment he had forgot - ten the shadowy figure of Goldstein . When you looked at O’Brien ’s powerful shoulders and his blunt - featured face , so ugly and yet so civilized , it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated . There was no stratagem that he was not equal to , no danger that he could not foresee . Even Julia
70901	71228	70897	70897	O’Brien	216	‘ You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood . No doubt you have formed your own picture of it . You have imagined , probably , a huge underworld of conspirators , meeting secretly in cellars , scribbling mes - sages on walls , recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand . Nothing of the kind exists . The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recogniz - ing one another , and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others . Gold - stein himself , if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police , could not give them a complete list of members , or any in - formation that would lead them to a complete list . No such list exists . The Brotherhood can not be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense . Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible . You will never have anything to sustain you , except the idea . You will get no comradeship and no encouragement . When fi - nally you are caught , you will get no help . We never help our members . At most , when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced , we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner ’s cell . You will have to get used to living without results and without hope . You will work for a while , you will be caught , you will confess , and then you will die . Those are the only results that you will ever see . There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime . We are the dead . Our only true life is in the future . We shall take part
71319	71333	71343	71343	comrade	3329	’ He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist- watch . ‘
71345	71352	71343	71343	comrade	3329	’ he said to Ju- lia . ‘
71362	71376	71355	71356	The decanter	2118	’ He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem . ‘
71384	71397	71355	71356	The decanter	2118	’ he said , still with the same faint suggestion of irony . ‘
71420	71421	71355	71356	The decanter	2118	’ ‘
71426	71430	71355	71356	The decanter	2118	’ said Winston . ‘
71437	71538	71355	71356	The decanter	2118	’ agreed O’Brien gravely . They emptied their glasses , and a moment later Julia stood up to go . O’Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue . It was important , he said , not to go out smelling of wine : the lift attendants were very obser - vant . As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence . He took another pace or two up and down , then stopped . ‘
71546	71550	71551	71551	I	0	’ he said . ‘
71564	71564	71551	71551	I	0	’
71579	71733	71734	71734	he	215	‘ That will do for the moment . Later we will arrange something else for you . It is important to change one ’s hid - ing - place frequently . Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of THE BOOK’—even O’Brien , Winston noticed , seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics—’Gold - stein ’s book , you understand , as soon as possible . It may be some days before I can get hold of one . There are not many in existence , as you can imagine . The Thought Police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them . It makes very little difference . The book is indestructible . If the last copy were gone , we could repro - duce it almost word for word . Do you carry a brief - case to work with you ? ’
71737	71744	71734	71734	he	215	‘ As a rule , yes . ’
71745	71751	71572	71575	Mr Char - rington	215	‘ What is it like ? ’
71752	71762	71734	71734	he	215	‘ Black , very shabby . With two straps . ’
71763	71852	71734	71734	he	215	‘ Black , two straps , very shabby — good . One day in the fairly near future — I can not give a date — one of the messag - es among your morning ’s work will contain a misprinted word , and you will have to ask for a repeat . On the following day you will go to work without your brief - case . At some time during the day , in the street , a man will touch you on the arm and say ‘
71863	71886	71887	71887	They	2123	’ The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein ’s book . You will return it within fourteen days . ’
71894	71906	71887	71887	They	2123	‘ There are a couple of minutes before you need go , ’
71915	71928	71929	71929	Winston	132	‘ We shall meet again — if we do meet again — — ’
71935	71945	71946	71946	he	132	‘ In the place where there is no darkness ? ’
71957	71967	71968	71968	he	132	‘ In the place where there is no darkness , ’
71979	72006	72007	72007	Winston	132	‘ And in the meantime , is there any - thing that you wish to say before you leave ? Any message ? Any question ? . ’
72105	72117	72102	72102	he	132	‘ Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins ‘
72129	72131	72133	72133	O’Brien	216	’ ? ’
72147	72198	72142	72142	he	132	’ Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement ’s , You owe me three farthings , say the bells of St Martin ’s , When will you pay me ? say the bells of Old Bailey , When I grow rich , say the bells of Shoreditch . ’
72199	72206	72208	72208	Winston	132	‘ You knew the last line ! ’
72210	72228	72208	72208	Winston	132	‘ Yes , I knew the last line . And now , I am afraid , it is time

At the door Winston looked back , but O’Brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind . He was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen . Beyond him Winston could see the writing - table with its green - shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep - laden with papers . The incident was closed . Within thirty seconds , it occurred to him , O’Brien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party .

The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High . The aim of the Low , when they have an aim — for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives — is to abolish all distinc - tions and create a society in which all men shall be equal . Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again . For long periods the High seem to be securely in power , but sooner or later

It should have been easy , but he always lost count at some point or another . More often he wondered where he was , and what time of day it was . At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside , and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness . In this place , he knew instinctively , the lights would never be turned out . It was the place with no darkness : he saw now why O’Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion . In the Ministry of Love there were no windows . His cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall ; it might be ten floors below ground , or thirty above it . He moved himself mentally from place to place , and tried to deter - mine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground . There was a sound of marching boots outside . The steel door opened with a clang . A young officer , a trim black - uni- formed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather , and whose pale , straight - featured face was like a wax mask , stepped smartly through the doorway . He mo - tioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading . The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell . The door clanged shut again . Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side , as though having some idea that there was an - other door to go out of , and then began to wander up and down the cell . He had not yet noticed Winston ’s presence .
93124	93127	93128	93128	he	132	‘ Ampleforth , ’
93153	93158	93159	93159	he	132	‘ Ah , Smith ! ’

93193	93204	93205	93205	he	132	‘ There is only one offence , is there not ? ’
93208	93215	93205	93205	he	132	‘ And have you committed it ? ’
93216	93221	93222	93222	He	132	‘ Apparently I have . ’

93535	93554	93519	93519	They	2795	’ His eyes flitted round the walls , as though he half expected to find a window somewhere . ‘
93580	93650	93569	93569	I	0	’ They talked desultorily for some minutes , then , without apparent reason , a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent . Winston sat quietly , his hands crossed . Ampleforth , too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench , fidgeted from side to side , clasping his lank hands first round one knee , then round the other . The telescreen barked at him to

I know they give you a fair hearing . Oh , I trust them for that ! They ’ll know my record , wo n’t they ? YOU know what kind of chap I was . Not a bad chap in my way . Not brainy , of course , but keen . I tried to do my best for the Party , did n’t I ? I ’ll get off with five years , do n’t you think ? Or even ten years ? A chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a labour - camp . They would n’t shoot me for going off the rails just once ? ’
94203	94208	94210	94210	Winston	132	‘ Are you guilty ? ’

95862	95912	95844	95844	I	0	’ said the officer . The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners , as though with some idea that he could put another victim in his own place . His eyes settled on the smashed face of the chinless man . He flung out a lean arm . ‘

But just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that sup - ported the bench . He had set up a wordless howling , like an animal . The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose , but he clung on with astonishing strength . For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him . The prisoners sat quiet , their hands crossed on their knees , looking straight in front of them . The howling stopped ; the man had no

In this place you could not feel anything , except pain and foreknowledge of pain . Besides , was it possible , when you were actually suffering it , to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase ? But that question was not an - swerable yet . The boots were approaching again . The door opened . O’Brien came in . Winston started to his feet . The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him . For the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen . ‘

96639	96673	96631	96631	They	2870	’ said O’Brien with a mild , almost regretful irony . He stepped aside . From behind him there emerged a broad - chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand . ‘

96701	96817	96690	96690	You	2871	’ Yes , he saw now , he had always known it . But there was no time to think of that . All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard ’s hand . It might fall anywhere ; on the crown , on the tip of the ear , on the upper arm , on the elbow — — The elbow ! He had slumped to his knees , almost para - lysed , clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand . Everything had exploded into yellow light . Inconceivable , inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain ! The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down

99216	99221	99223	99223	O’Brien	216	‘ You are afraid , ’
99229	99284	99285	99285	Winston	132	‘ that in another moment something is going to break . Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone . You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them . That is what you are thinking , is it not , Winston ? ’
99313	99318	99320	99320	O’Brien	216	‘ That was forty , ’
99322	99411	99320	99320	O’Brien	216	‘ You can see that the num - bers on this dial run up to a hundred . Will you please remember , throughout our conversation , that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to what- ever degree I choose ? If you tell me any lies , or attempt to prevaricate in any way , or even fall below your usual level of intelligence , you will cry out with pain , instantly . Do you understand that ? ’
99412	99415	99417	99417	Winston	132	‘ Yes , ’
99477	99487	99488	99488	he	132	‘ I am taking trouble with you , Winston , ’
99491	99636	99488	99488	he	132	‘ because you are worth trouble . You know perfectly well what is the matter with you . You have known it for years , though you have fought against the knowledge . You are mentally de - ranged . You suffer from a defective memory . You are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened . Fortunately it is curable . You have never cured yourself of it , because you did not choose to . There was a small effort of the will that you were not ready to make . Even now , I am well aware , you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue . Now we will take an example . At this moment , which power is Oceania at war with ? ’
99642	99655	99488	99488	he	132	‘ When I was arrested , Oceania was at war with Eastasia . ’
99656	99676	99677	99677	Winston	132	‘ With Eastasia . Good . And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia , has it not ? ’
99706	99725	99695	99695	He	132	‘ The truth , please , Winston . YOUR truth . Tell me what you think you remember . ’
99726	99773	99774	99774	O’Brien	216	‘ I remember that until only a week before I was arrested , we were not at war with Eastasia at all . We were in alliance with them . The war was against Eurasia . That had lasted for four years . Before that — — ’
99784	99788	99789	99789	he	216	‘ Another example , ’
99792	99900	99789	99789	he	216	‘ Some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed . You believed that three men , three one - time Party members named Jones , Aaronson , and Rutherford — men who were executed for treachery and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession — were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with . You believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evi - dence proving that their confessions were false . There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination . You believed that you had actually held it in your hands . It was a photograph something like this . ’

100168	100193	100147	100147	he	185	‘ But it did exist ! It does exist ! It exists in memory . I re - member it . You remember it . ’

100509	100560	100506	100506	he	185	‘ Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence . I will put it more precisely . Does the past exist concretely , in space ? Is there somewhere or other a place , a world of solid objects , where the past is still happening ? ’
100561	100564	100506	100506	he	185	‘ No . ’
100565	100577	100506	100506	he	185	‘ Then where does the past exist , if at all ? ’
100578	100587	100506	100506	he	185	‘ In records . It is written down . ’
100588	100596	100506	100506	he	185	‘ In records . And — — ? ’
100597	100606	100506	100506	he	185	‘ In the mind . In human memories . ’

100653	100662	100639	100639	we	2940	’ cried Winston again momentarily forgetting the dial . ‘
100686	100702	100680	100680	You	2941	’ O’Brien ’s manner grew stern again . He laid his hand on the dial . ‘
100707	100711	100712	100712	YOU	2941	’ he said , ‘
100954	100966	100944	100944	You	2941	’ He paused for a few moments , as though to allow what

101055	101058	100986	100986	he	132	‘ Four . ’
101059	101077	101021	101021	O’Brien	216	‘ And if the party says that it is not four but five — then how many ? ’
101078	101081	101021	101021	O’Brien	216	‘ Four . ’
101165	101172	101150	101150	He	216	‘ How many fingers , Winston ? ’

101294	101301	101239	101239	his	216	‘ Five ! Five ! Five ! ’
101302	101329	101239	101239	his	216	‘ No , Winston , that is no use . You are lying . You still think there are four . How many fingers , please ? ’
101330	101349	101351	101351	he	216	‘ Four ! five ! Four ! Anything you like . Only stop it , stop the pain ! ’
101469	101478	101480	101480	O’Brien	216	‘ You are a slow learner , Winston , ’
101483	101490	101491	101491	he	216	‘ How can I help it ? ’
101494	101514	101517	101517	Winston	132	‘ How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes ? Two and two are four . ’
101553	101620	101540	101540	You	2953	’ He laid Winston down on the bed . The grip of his limbs tightened again , but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped , leaving him merely weak and cold . O’Brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat , who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings . The man in the white coat bent down and looked closely
101653	101656	101658	101658	O’Brien	216	‘ Again , ’
101744	101751	101737	101737	O’Brien	216	‘ How many fingers , Winston ? ’
101752	101776	101737	101737	O’Brien	216	‘ Four . I suppose there are four . I would see five if I could . I am trying to see five . ’
101777	101797	101737	101737	O’Brien	216	‘ Which do you wish : to persuade me that you see five , or really to see them ? ’
101798	101804	101737	101737	O’Brien	216	‘ Really to see them . ’
101805	101808	101810	101810	O’Brien	216	‘ Again , ’
101957	101968	101950	101950	He	132	‘ How many fingers am I holding up , Winston ? ’
101969	102004	101950	101950	He	132	‘ I do n’t know . I do n’t know . You will kill me if you do that again . Four , five , six — in all honesty I do n’t know . ’
102005	102008	102010	102010	O’Brien	216	‘ Better , ’
102278	102288	102289	102289	he	216	‘ Do you know where you are , Winston ? ’
102292	102308	102289	102289	he	216	‘ I do n’t know . I can guess . In the Ministry of Love . ’
102309	102320	102267	102267	he	216	‘ Do you know how long you have been here ? ’
102326	102344	102289	102289	he	216	‘ I do n’t know . Days , weeks , months — I think it is months . ’
102345	102359	102289	102289	he	216	‘ And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place ? ’
102360	102366	102289	102289	he	216	‘ To make them confess . ’
102367	102379	102289	102289	he	216	‘ No , that is not the reason . Try again . ’
102380	102385	102289	102289	he	216	‘ To punish them . ’
102386	102389	102391	102391	O’Brien	216	‘ No ! ’
102412	102524	102525	102525	He	2961	‘ No ! Not merely to extract your confession , not to punish you . Shall I tell you why we have brought you here ? To cure you ! To make you sane ! Will you understand , Win - ston , that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured ? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed . The Party is not interested in the overt act : the thought is all we care about . We do not merely destroy our enemies , we change them . Do you un - derstand what I mean by that ? ’
102628	102651	102623	102623	he	132	‘ The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms . You have read of the religious
103075	103118	103119	103119	You	2978	’ Then why bother to torture me ? thought Winston , with a momentary bitterness . O’Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the thought aloud . His large ugly face came nearer , with the eyes a little narrowed . ‘
103123	103127	103119	103119	You	2978	’ he said , ‘
103180	103181	103172	103172	you	2978	’ ‘
103184	103192	103193	103193	You	2978	’ said Winston . O’Brien smiled slightly . ‘
103448	103461	103462	103462	Thou	2988	‘ Thou shalt not ” . The command of the total- itarians was ‘
103469	103628	103629	103629	His	2989	‘ THOU ART ” . No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us . Everyone is washed clean . Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed — Jones , Aar - onson , and Rutherford — in the end we broke them down . I took part in their interrogation myself . I saw them gradu - ally worn down , whimpering , grovelling , weeping — and in the end it was not with pain or fear , only with penitence . By the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men . There was nothing left in them except sor - row for what they had done , and love of Big Brother . It was touching to see how they loved him . They begged to be shot quickly , so that they could die while their minds were still clean . ’
103801	103974	103975	103975	He	2990	‘ Do not imagine that you will save yourself , Winston , however completely you surrender to us . No one who has once gone astray is ever spared . And even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life , still you would never escape from us . What happens to you here is for ever . Understand that in advance . We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back . Things will happen to you from which you could not recover , if you lived a thousand years . Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling . Everything will be dead inside you . Never again will you be capable of love , or friendship , or joy of living , or laughter , or curiosity , or courage , or in - tegrity . You will be hollow . We shall squeeze you empty , and then we shall fill you with ourselves . ’
104025	104029	104030	104030	he	132	‘ Three thousand , ’
104093	104101	104102	104102	he	132	‘ This time it will not hurt , ’
104105	104113	104102	104102	he	132	‘ Keep your eyes fixed on mine . ’
104257	104263	104265	104265	O’Brien	216	‘ It will not last , ’
104267	104282	104283	104283	Winston	132	‘ Look me in the eyes . What country is Oceania at war with ? ’
104337	104343	104326	104326	he	132	‘ I do n’t remember . ’
104344	104358	104326	104326	he	132	‘ Oceania is at war with Eastasia . Do you remember that now ? ’
104359	104362	104326	104326	he	132	‘ Yes . ’
104368	104418	104326	104326	he	132	‘ Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia . Since the beginning of your life , since the beginning of the Party , since the beginning of history , the war has continued with - out a break , always the same war . Do you remember that ? ’
104419	104422	104326	104326	he	132	‘ Yes . ’
104423	104501	104326	104326	he	132	‘ Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery . You pre - tended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent . No such piece of paper ever existed . You in - vented it , and later you grew to believe in it . You remember now the very moment at which you first invented it . Do you remember that ? ’
104502	104505	104326	104326	he	132	‘ Yes . ’
104506	104530	104326	104326	he	132	‘ Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you . You saw five fingers . Do you remember that ? ’

104550	104563	104535	104535	O’Brien	216	‘ There are five fingers there . Do you see five fingers ? ’
104564	104567	104569	104569	he	216	‘ Yes . ’
104734	104739	104741	104741	O’Brien	216	‘ You see now , ’
104743	104754	104741	104741	O’Brien	216	‘ that it is at any rate possi - ble . ’
104755	104758	104760	104760	Winston	132	‘ Yes , ’
104815	104824	104825	104825	he	132	‘ Do you remember writing in your diary , ’
104828	104908	104825	104825	he	132	‘ that it did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy , since I was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to ? You were right . I enjoy talking to you . Your mind appeals to me . It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane . Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions , if you choose . ’
104909	104915	104825	104825	he	132	‘ Any question I like ? ’
104916	104919	104920	104920	He	132	‘ Anything . ’
104931	104943	104923	104923	Winston	132	‘ It is switched off . What is your first question ? ’
104944	104952	104954	104954	Winston	132	‘ What have you done with Julia ? ’
104960	105018	104956	104956	O’Brien	216	‘ She betrayed you , Winston . I m - mediately — unreservedly . I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly . You would hardly recognize her if you saw her . All her rebelliousness , her deceit , her folly , her dirty - mindedness — everything has been burned out of her .

105040	105046	105036	105036	You	3000	’ O’Brien left this unanswered . ‘

105100	105147	105148	105148	You	3000	’ said O’Brien . Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him . He knew , or he could imagine , the arguments which proved his own nonexistence ; but they were nonsense , they were only a play on words . Did not the statement , ‘
105153	105188	105148	105148	You	3000	’ , contain a logical absurdity ? But what use was it to say so ? His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable , mad arguments with which O’Brien would demolish him . ‘

106082	106086	106143	106143	he	3012	’ he repeated . ‘
106097	106099	106143	106143	he	3012	‘ how ’
106101	106142	106143	106143	he	3012	‘ why ” . You understand well enough HOW the Party maintains itself in power . Now tell me WHY we cling to power . What is our motive ? Why should we want power ? Go on , speak , ’
106450	106461	106462	106462	he	132	‘ You are ruling over us for our own good , ’
106466	106485	106486	106486	He	132	‘ You believe that human beings are not fit to govern them - selves , and therefore — — ’
106517	106526	106527	106527	he	132	‘ That was stupid , Winston , stupid ! ’
106530	106543	106544	106544	He	132	‘ You should know better than to say a thing like that . ’
106553	106818	106819	106819	Winston	132	‘ Now I will tell you the answer to my question . It is this . The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake . We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power . Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness : only power , pure power . What pure power means you will understand presently . We are different from all the oligar - chies of the past , in that we know what we are doing . All the others , even those who resembled ourselves , were cow - ards and hypocrites . The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods , but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives . They pretended , perhaps they even believed , that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time , and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human be - ings would be free and equal . We are not like that . We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relin - quishing it . Power is not a means , it is an end . One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution ; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictator - ship . The object of persecution is persecution . The object of torture is torture . The object of power is power . Now do you begin to understand me ? ’
106901	106906	106907	106907	he	216	‘ You are thinking , ’
106910	106982	106983	106983	He	216	‘ that my face is old and tired . You are thinking that I talk of power , and yet I am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body . Can you not un - derstand , Winston , that the individual is only a cell ? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism . Do you die when you cut your fingernails ? ’
107003	107011	107012	107012	he	216	‘ We are the priests of power , ’
107015	107083	107012	107012	he	216	‘ God is power . But at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned . It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means . The first thing you must realize is that power is collective . The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual . You know the Party slogan : ‘
107237	107270	107284	107284	You	3031	’ For a moment Winston ignored the dial . He made a vio - lent effort to raise himself into a sitting position , and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully . ‘
107278	107283	107284	107284	You	3031	’ he burst out . ‘
107308	107319	107320	107320	We	3037	’ O’Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand . ‘

107671	107677	107679	107679	O’Brien	216	‘ What are the stars ? ’
107682	107729	107730	107730	Winston	132	‘ They are bits of fire a few kilometres away . We could reach them if we wanted to . Or we could blot them out . The earth is the cen - tre of the universe . The sun and the stars go round it . ’
107755	107862	107744	107744	O’Brien	216	‘ For certain purposes , of course , that is not true . When we navigate the ocean , or when we predict an eclipse , we of - ten find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of ki - lometres away . But what of it ? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy ? The stars can be near or distant , according as we need them . Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that ? Have you forgot - ten doublethink ? ’
107962	107969	107970	107970	he	132	‘ I told you , Winston , ’

108067	108087	108090	108091	one man	3057	’ He paused , and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil : ‘

108110	108114	108098	108098	Winston	132	’ he said . ‘
108610	108652	108590	108590	you	3077	’ He paused as though he expected Winston to speak . Winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again . He could not say anything . His heart seemed to be frozen . O’Brien went on : ‘
108969	108978	108979	108979	You	3085	’ Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak . ‘
108983	108988	108979	108979	You	3085	’ he said weakly . ‘

109078	109164	109172	109172	Winston	132	‘ Nonsense . You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love . Why should it be ? And if it were , what difference would that make ? Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster . Suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty . Still what difference would it make ? Can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death ? The party is immor - tal . ’
109231	109258	109225	109225	he	132	‘ I do n’t know — I do n’t care . Somehow you will fail . Some- thing will defeat you . Life will defeat you . ’
109259	109358	109225	109225	he	132	‘ We control life , Winston , at all its levels . You are imag - ining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us . But we create human nature . Men are infinitely malleable . Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the prole - tarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us . Put it out of your mind . They are helpless , like the animals . Humanity is the Party . The others are outside — irrelevant . ’
109359	109394	109225	109225	he	132	‘ I do n’t care . In the end they will beat you . Sooner or later they will see you for what you are , and then they will tear you to pieces . ’
109396	109414	109225	109225	he	132	‘ Do you see any evidence that that is happening ? Or any reason why it should ? ’
109415	109453	109225	109225	he	132	‘ No . I believe it . I KNOW that you will fail . There is something in the universe — I do n’t know , some spirit , some principle — that you will never overcome . ’
109454	109463	109225	109225	he	132	‘ Do you believe in God , Winston ? ’
109464	109467	109225	109225	he	132	‘ No . ’
109468	109481	109225	109225	he	132	‘ Then what is it , this principle that will defeat us ? ’
109482	109493	109225	109225	he	132	‘ I do n’t know . The spirit of Man . ’
109494	109503	109225	109225	he	132	‘ And do you consider yourself a man ? ’
109504	109507	109225	109225	he	132	‘ Yes . ’
109508	109551	109225	109225	he	132	‘ If you are a man , Winston , you are the last man . Your kind is extinct ; we are the inheritors . Do you understand that you are ALONE ? You are outside history , you are non- existent . ’
109561	109578	109556	109556	he	3087	‘ And you consider yourself morally superior to us , with our lies and our cruelty ? ’
109579	109587	109588	109588	O’Brien	216	‘ Yes , I consider myself superior . ’
109707	109714	109715	109715	he	132	‘ Get up from that bed , ’

110280	110286	110288	110288	O’Brien	216	‘ You have thought sometimes , ’
110290	110319	110320	110320	He	132	‘ that my face — the face of a member of the Inner Party — looks old and worn . What do you think of your own face ? ’

110349	110442	110346	110346	he	132	‘ Look at this filthy grime all over your body . Look at the dirt between your toes . Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg . Do you know that you stink like a goat ? Probably you have ceased to notice it . Look at your emaciation . Do you see ? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep . I could snap your neck like a carrot . Do you know that you have lost twenty - five kilograms since you have been in our

110515	110562	110563	110563	You	3093	’ He seized one of Winston ’s remaining front teeth be - tween his powerful thumb and forefinger . A twinge of pain shot through Winston ’s jaw . O’Brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots . He tossed it across the cell . ‘
110568	110572	110563	110563	You	3093	’ he said ; ‘
110628	110767	110599	110599	you	3093	’ Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff move - ments . Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was . Only one thought stirred in his mind : that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined . Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him . Before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears . He was aware of his ugliness , his gracelessness , a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light : but he could not stop himself . O’Brien laid a hand on his shoulder , almost kindly . ‘
110775	110779	110780	110780	You	3096	’ he said . ‘
110794	110795	110796	110796	You	3096	’ ‘

110813	110814	110817	110817	Winston	132	’ ‘
110857	110866	110867	110867	We	3097	’ He paused , and then went on : ‘
110965	110988	110989	110989	I	0	’ Winston had stopped weeping , though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes . He looked up at O’Brien . ‘
110995	111006	110989	110989	I	0	’ he said . O’Brien looked down at him thoughtfully . ‘
111009	111013	110989	110989	I	0	’ he said ; ‘
111027	111142	111021	111021	You	207	’ The peculiar reverence for O’Brien , which nothing seemed able to destroy , flooded Winston ’s heart again . How intelligent , he thought , how intelligent ! Never did O’Brien fail to understand what was said to him . Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he HAD be - trayed Julia . For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture ? He had told them everything he knew about her , her habits , her character , her past life ; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings , all that he had said to her

111249	111278	111225	111225	he	12	‘ You are a difficult case . But do n’t give up hope . Everyone is cured sooner or later . In the end we shall shoot you . ’

112825	112851	112820	112820	Winston	132	‘ If he THINKS he floats off the floor , and if I simultaneously THINK I see him do it , then the thing happens . ’

115354	115395	115348	115348	you	3150	’ O’Brien made no direct answer . When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected . He looked thoughtfully into the distance , as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind Winston ’s back . ‘

115704	115799	115694	115694	O’Brien	216	‘ although a rodent , is carnivorous . You are aware of that . You will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town . In some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house , even for five minutes . The rats are certain to attack it . Within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones . They also attack sick or dy - ing people . They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless . ’
115930	115938	115940	115940	O’Brien	216	‘ I have pressed the first lever , ’
115942	115971	115940	115940	O’Brien	216	‘ You under - stand the construction of this cage . The mask will fit over your head , leaving no exit . When I press this other lever ,

But he fought furiously against his panic . To think , to think , even with a split second left — to think was the only hope . Suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils . There was a violent convul - sion of nausea inside him , and he almost lost consciousness . Everything had gone black . For an instant he was insane , a screaming animal . Yet he came out of the blackness clutch - ing an idea . There was one and only one way to save himself . He must interpose another human being , the BODY of an - other human being , between himself and the rats . The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else . The wire door was a couple of hand - spans from his face . The rats knew what was coming now . One of them was leaping up and down , the other , an old scaly grandfather of the sewers , stood up , with his pink hands against the bars , and fiercely sniffed the air . Winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth . Again the black panic took hold of him . He was blind , helpless , mindless . ‘

Almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence : besides , it was too cold to keep still . She said something about catch- ing her Tube and stood up to go . ‘

The stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank . But it had become the element he swam in . It was his life , his death , and his resurrection . It was gin that sank him into stupor every night , and gin that revived him every morning . When he woke , seldom before eleven hundred , with gummed - up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken , it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight . Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face , the bottle handy , lis - tening to the telescreen . From fifteen to closing - time he was a fixture in the Chestnut Tree . No one cared what he did any longer , no whistle woke him , no telescreen admon - ished him . Occasionally , perhaps twice a week , he went to a dusty , forgotten - looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did a little work , or what was called work . He had been ap - pointed to a sub - committee of a sub - committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary . They were engaged in producing something called an Interim Report , but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out . It was something to do with the ques - tion of whether commas should be placed inside brackets ,

He had not stirred from his seat , but in his mind he was running , swiftly running , he was with the crowds outside , cheering himself deaf . He looked up again at the portrait of Big Brother . The colossus that bestrode the world ! The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain ! He thought how ten minutes ago — yes , only ten minutes — there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat . Ah , it was more than a Eur - asian army that had perished ! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry of Love , but the final , in - dispensable , healing change had never happened , until this moment . The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter , but the shouting outside had died down a little . The waiters were turning back to their work . One of them approached with the gin bottle . Winston , sitting in a blissful dream , paid no at - tention as his glass was filled up . He was not running or cheering any longer . He was back in the Ministry of Love , with everything forgiven , his soul white as snow . He was in the public dock , confessing everything , implicating every - body . He was walking down the white - tiled corridor , with the feeling of walking in sunlight , and an armed guard at his back . The long - hoped - for bullet was entering his brain . He gazed up at the enormous face . Forty years it had tak -
